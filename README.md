# Titanic Survival Analysis and Decision Tree

The code performs analysis on Titanic survival data and implements a decision tree model to predict survival based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, entropy calculation, decision tree training, and evaluation using confusion matrix and precision-recall-f1 scores.

## Topics:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Dataset Splitting and Visualization
- Entropy Calculation and Decision Tree Split
- Decision Tree Training and Inference
- Confusion Matrix Computation
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score Calculation
## Note:

- The code is structured into logical segments for easy comprehension and modification.
- Visualizations aid in understanding the dataset and model predictions.
- Evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's performance in predicting survival.
